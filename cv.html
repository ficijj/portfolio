                    Our technology stack included TypeScript on the frontend, Kotlin on the backend, and MongoDB as our database. 
                    We tied this all together using Spring Webflux, a framework for creating reactive web applications. Spring Data was also used to easily 
                    interact with the database.

                <li>
                    AWS was used as our build, deployment, and hosting tool. The build process included running a full suite of unit and system integration tests, 
                    which I had a personal hand in implementing.
